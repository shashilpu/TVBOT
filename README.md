# TradingView Bot

## Overview

Welcome to the TradingView Bot repository! This project is a comprehensive trading bot developed in C# as a Windows Service, utilizing SQL Server for data storage. The bot leverages the TradingView API to fetch EMA and MACD crossover signals for all NSE stocks across multiple time frames. It includes features such as volume checks, analyst ratings, and the latest news for specific tickers. The bot can execute trades based on buy signals, manage stop-loss and trailing stop-loss, and send notifications to a Telegram channel.
